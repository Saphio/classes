# classes
simple practice using classes with .h files, constructors and destructors, and inheritance. 

ADD adds a new kind of media (music, movie, or video game).

SEARCH searches for media based on title (t) or year (y). 

DELETE deletes media (and can delete multiple at a time).

PRINT prints all media. use this for debugging purposes.

QUIT quits the program.

to compile:

```g++ *.cpp```
